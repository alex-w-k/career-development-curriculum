*How will you focus your learning to accomplish your longterm goal?*

I will try and work on some of the above stuff every day.

*How will you continue researching companies and contacts? How will you utilize your Trello Board?* 

Add new people when I meet them and try and schedule everything I can.

#### Cold Outreach/Network:

I will talk to Charles, and anyone else in the mentors list that lists DevOps in Denver.
