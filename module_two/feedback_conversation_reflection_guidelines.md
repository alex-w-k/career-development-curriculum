# Feedback II Reflection

* Date of feedback conversation: 

5/10/17

* How did you prepare for the conversation? 

I prepared by thinking back over the project and seeing what could have gone a bit better.
I think overall the project has gone really well, but some of the things that could have gone better was a bit more of use out of the Waffle thing I know I didn't use it much but it could have helped be a bit more clear what everyone was working on. It didn't really lead to any problems that I know of but I think that on a larger project it could have gotten a little more crazy.

* How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult? 

Great. We have specific action items to work on for the rest of this project and for the next projects here at Turing.
More testing and more waffling.


* What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation?

Active listening. 

* Any other comments:

none.
